# Running Visual Studio as an Admin

1. Find __devenv.exe__ or shortcut.  Search for Visual Studio, right click, select "Open File Location"
1. Right click __devenv.exe__ as select "Troubleshoot Compatibility". Select "Troubleshoot Program"
1. In menu, select "The program requires additional permissions", and next.
1. Test the program.
1. If it runs as an admin (for me, I get a "Run as admin" security prompt), then you're good to go. 
1. "yes" to save the changes
1. Enjoy!
